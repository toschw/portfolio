# Meet Toby

Toby has more than 15 years of public-policy experience relevant to Alaska, the Arctic, and other countries. With a diverse background in economics and the natural sciences, he develops innovative techniques for decision-making in the public and private sectors. He has led a range of projects that include assessing the value of the environment to local livelihoods, analyzing alternative energy options in collaboration with rural communities, and measuring the contribution of Alaskaâ€™s basic sector industries to the overall economy.

Much of his current research focuses on human dimensions of sustainable systems, with the goal of informing policy through applied economic analysis. Most recently, he has been studying human responses to environmental risk related to aquatic invasive species and climate change. {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" %}}Download my CV{{% /staticref %}}
