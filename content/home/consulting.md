Besides my main appointment at the University of Alaska Anchorage, I occasionally provide private research and consulting services for private clients in compliance with the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act (AS 39.52). 

For this work, I specialize in regional economic analysis that investigates the economic contribution of the private sector to the larger regional economy. I also advise private clients on best practices in data collection and data management to improve reproducibility of workflows for quantitative analysis. 

Former clients include Flint Hills Resources, Alaska Mobility Coalition, Doyon Limited, Alaska Oil and Gas Association, Coeur Mining and various other companies.
