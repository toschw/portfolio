Alaska’s wild salmon are essential to Alaska’s cultures and economies and reflect a long tradition of stewardship. However, shifts in climate patterns, access and equity concerns, and other pressures increasingly threaten Alaska salmon and the people who depend on them.The State of Alaska’s Salmon and People (SASAP) project [State of Alaska’s Salmon and People (SASAP) project](https://alaskasalmonandpeople.org/ "This link will get you to the SASAP website")is a collaboration of researchers, cultural leaders, and others working to bring together integrated, accurate, and up-to-date information that will help to support better salmon decision-making.

SASAP’s mission is to create an equitable decision-making platform for all stakeholders by addressing data gaps in Alaska’s salmon system through information synthesis, collaboration and stakeholder engagement.

This project is led by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Nautilus Impact Investing (NII) in Anchorage, Alaska. SASAP is collaborating with and engaging leading experts at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks and Anchorage, indigenous leaders, and specialists across resource sectors.

As part of this project, we showed interactive graphs for example for the number of permits that left or were received by residents and non-residents over time. Move your mouse over the graph to see permit movements across regions and time periods.
